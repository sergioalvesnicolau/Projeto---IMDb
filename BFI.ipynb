With creature effects by the Oscar-winning creator of E.T, Carlos Rambaldi, Possession is filmmaking at its most frenzied, fraught and furious.</p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Andrzej Zulawski\",\"producer\":\"Marie-Laure Reyre\",\"writer\":\"Andrzej Zulawski\",\"featuring\":\"Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Margit Carstensen\"},\"year\":\"1981\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Possession (1981)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-possession-1981-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-possession-1981-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/4001\",\"pillar\":\"subscription\",\"price\":0,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"France, Federal Republic of Germany\",\"runningTime\":127,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":243,\"tied\":true,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"ecba7a8f-50cd-5f8f-a071-a4bdda4519c3\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Soleil Ô\",\"url\":\"/film/ecba7a8f-50cd-5f8f-a071-a4bdda4519c3/soleil-\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"A vibrant humanist statement on racism and immigration that remains pertinent today.\",\"html\":\"<p>A vibrant humanist statement on racism and immigration that remains pertinent today.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Med Hondo\",\"producer\":\"\",\"writer\":\"\",\"featuring\":\"Robert Liensol, Théo Legitimus, Yane Barry\"},\"year\":\"1970\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Soleil Ô (1970)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":null,\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[],\"productionCountries\":\"France\",\"runningTime\":0,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":243,\"tied\":true,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"930b2196-1cac-5219-932f-353eff1c2cda\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Distant Voices Still Lives\",\"url\":\"/film/930b2196-1cac-5219-932f-353eff1c2cda/distant-voices-still-lives\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Post-war working-class Liverpool life is impressionistically evoked in Terence Davies’ two-part film, by turns lyrical, humorous and horrific.\",\"html\":\"<p>Post-war working-class Liverpool life is impressionistically evoked in Terence Davies’ two-part film, by turns lyrical, humorous and horrific.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>Set in a world before Elvis, a Liverpool before the Beatles, Terence Davies' debut feature is a remarkable evocation of working-class family life in the 40s and 50s and a visionary exploration of memory.

Its original Thai title, Sud Pralad, in fact means something like ‘strange beast’. This is perhaps a more apt characterisation of a film that compels through fierce natural strangeness rather than intimations of illness per se. More is going on here in terms of story, sense perception, sexuality, identity and spirituality than is easily accessible to mainstream sensibilities. But if that speaks to malady, it seems less a matter of infection or disease than the disordered expectation that the world will constrain itself to conventionally limited and contingent ways of thinking, feeling and understanding. Strange beasts are best met on their own ground, on their own terms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The film is a diptych of sorts. The first part introduces us to soldier Keng (Banlop Lomnoi), part of a group assigned to a rural area where unsettling killings of animals have been noted, perhaps the work of an unquiet spirit – the strange beast. There, Keng meets Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee), a placid-seeming young man with whom he strikes up a flirtatious rapport. They spend time together in town and country, at the movies, taking a dog to the vet, exploring nearby shrines. In the second part, Keng is in the forest, alone, tracking and being tracked by the strange spirit, who seems to be at once Tong and a tiger. There are stalkings, struggles and submissions, encounters with ghost cows and clever monkeys. In both parts, transportive sound design and locked-off compositions frame interpersonal dynamics&nbsp;that tilt in unexpected ways. Queerness here is not only a matter of same-sex desire but of radical uncertainty, shifts between persons and worlds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s a work that defies straightforward understanding and suggests that understandability may be overrated. (Benedict Anderson has argued that aspects of narrative, setting and character unfamiliar to the film’s cosmopolitan audiences are quite accessible to viewers from the region where the film was shot – yet even they were perplexed by other elements.)

Like Alfred Hitchcock in the same year’s Psycho, Michelangelo Antonioni upturned expectation by getting rid of his film’s ostensible protagonist early on. Unlike Hitchcock, however, Antonioni provided no explanation for this sudden disappearance of his female star, hinting only at the alienation and ennui that the film depicts as a characteristic of contemporary bourgeois society as a potential cause.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No less radical than this modernistic ambiguity was the Italian master’s controlled use of camera movement and visual composition to dramatise the emotional space between people. The film made a star of Monica Vitti, who plays Claudia, the missing woman’s friend.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece changed the course of Italian neorealism and arthouse cinema.

Moving on to La notte (1961), Blow-Up (1966) and The Passenger (1975), this was an artist who epitomised the auteurist possibility of a singular cinematic vision structured across an entire body of work. I later saw a documentary on Antonioni in which he described himself as the proponent of the “cinema of miscommunication” – a statement as insightful as it was self-aware. Ironically, his central insight is the modernist breakdown of coherence and unity, in cinema and life.

(His Oscar-winner Spirited Away, nearby in this poll, spills forth a phantasmic bathhouse of troubled ghouls.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>My Neighbour Totoro is his less-is-more work: a pastoral, pantheist chamber drama, where the ‘chamber’ lies under the canopy of a great camphor tree that lords over the woods behind a tumbledown farmhouse. Into this adventure realm move two sisters, pre-school Mei and preteen Satsuke, with their inattentive dad, to be nearer their hospitalised mum. Each in&nbsp;turn encounters the spirit of the woods: a giant, furry, ovoid mammal with mighty powers of flying, horticulture and slumber. (He comes with two smaller surrogates, who may or may not indicate a further world of totori.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The storytelling is as simple as Totoro is inscrutable, unfolding in a series of delightful, exquisitely constructed sequences: Satsuke and Mei discovering the farmhouse and its soot-sprite occupants; Mei tracking Totoro’s minions to his lair; the tired children, waiting in the rain for their dad at a bus stop, finding Totoro waiting too – for a twinkle-eyed cat bus; a village-wide hunt for Mei after a misunderstood message from hospital leads her to run away. My favourite is the nocturne in which the girls and Totoros conjure shoots from acorns with an incantatory dance, then soar triumphant through the trees on a spinning top.&nbsp;There’s no plot, just rousing impressions of innocence and experience.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So many films ask us to see the adult world through children’s eyes; My Neighbour Totoro summons wilder, wide-eyed wonder at the forces that inform us: life, nature, connection, change.

For writer-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it represented a triumphant attempt to create a ‘composed film’ in which music – here by Brian Easdale – plays a more central role, demanding similar expressive intensity in every detail of design and performance. Fittingly, it won Oscars for both art direction and music.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“It’s hard to think of many films that match The Red Shoes for ferocity and passion, since in every costume, set, and streak of grease paint there is desire. Moira Shearer’s performance as an ambitious ballerina is a tour de force. Jack Cardiff ’s moody colour work takes on a life of its own on screen.

Black women, in whose image the 1991 feature was directly created, saw then what is now widely understood: Dash’s visionary visual marriage between Afrocentric aesthetics and the rich emotional depth of Black womanhood is a cinematic triumph.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Daughters rapidly engulfs you with the lush, matriarchal world of the Peazant family, residing in South Carolina’s Sea Islands at the turn of the 20th century. The fundamental crisis takes shape as the women-centred family is split between migrating north or staying in the South Carolina Lowcountry. Dash’s multilayered narrative unfolds by allowing the youngest member of the clan, an unborn child, and the eldest members, the ancestors, to weigh in, in an energetic display of shared narrative.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Through a union of African diasporic storytelling techniques, visually arresting imagery (assisted by cinematographer and co-producer Arthur Jafa) and dynamic character scope, Daughters offers a deep reading of how ancestry and the depth of Black souls are fractured between a longing for modernity and tending to their roots. As the women try to work towards a collective solution and honour their individual paths,&nbsp;Dash invites us through their interiority. By doing so, we are granted access to the cinematic language of Black women defining themselves for themselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The film, which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, remains an enduring symphony that sings, reframes and reignites a Black girl’s song.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>By refusing a Eurocentric understanding of African-American identity, Dash’s seminal work challenges us all to believe in cinema’s creation – and viewing – as an act of communal healing. With this cinematic heirloom leading the way, may we all continue to.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Maya S.

Anticipating Jean-Luc Godard and postmodernism by decades, the detective fantasy Sherlock Jr. largely takes place inside the head of a hapless and wronged cinema projectionist (Keaton) who – in a sequence that’s a technical marvel to this day – dreams himself into the screen only to be flummoxed by the film’s editing.

The operative word however, is widely: it got great reviews from its moment of premiere in 1978. So why the recognition gap? In some ways it’s a story that parallels the film itself: it simply lacked the cultural benefits of more privileged contemporary productions.  Killer of Sheep was made on shoestring while writer/director Charles Burnett was still a student at UCLA, studying under luminaries including Basil Wright and Elyseo Taylor. Despite the looming presence of Hollywood, Burnett found inspiration in the Italian Neorealist films he saw in class, and defying expectations, adapted the department’s resources to tell tales of a previously undocumented America: everyday lives amongst the black community he knew in East Los Angeles.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But just as the film’s subjects were in a sense ghetto-ized, so was the film. Without funds available music rights couldn’t be cleared, and the film spent several decades as highly lauded marginalia. I first saw it in a poor-quality 16mm print in the mid 1980’s: the only way it could be seen at the time. The picture was soft and the dialogue muffled, leaving me with the memory of a feeling as much as anything else. It wasn’t till I was fortunate to restore the film for the UCLA Film & Television Archive in the early 2000’s – when improved laboratory techniques allowing Burnett’s brilliant photography and dialogue to emerge – that I realized its true genius. The visionary team at Milestone Films concurred, going through Herculean battles to clear the music rights, and launched its first international 35mm release in 2007, a full thirty years after its completion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Suddenly wide audiences throughout the world were seeing scenes that have since been etched forever in our collective memory: young children filmed from below as the leap across the gap between tenement rooftops; a hard-won car engine teetering precariously on the edge of a departing truck, the sad lonely dance of slaughterhouse worker Henry Sanders and his wife, Kaycee Moore.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Upon the restoration’s premiere, I was occasionally fortunate to present the film with Charles in attendance, and would introduce him not as one of America’s “great black directors” but rather as one of the “great American directors.”  It’s true he’s spent a career championing black lives in his storytelling, but I always felt the former term was not enough, and implied a privileging the work decried.

After the popular and critical success of his state-of-the-nation paparazzi drama La dolce vita (1960), Federico Fellini found himself at an artistic impasse. The fog lifted when he turned to his own situation for inspiration, casting Marcello Mastroianni as his alter ego, famous Italian director Guido Anselmi.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Taking its title from the number of films Fellini had completed up to this point (including some short segments for anthology films), 8½ features Guido being besieged by sycophants and collaborators as he struggles to get started on an unwieldy science-fiction epic. Frequently digressing into surreal and erotic dream sequences, Fellini’s self-reflexive movie about movie-making climaxes with an exuberant parade in which Guido directs the colourful cast of characters who have played supporting roles in his life.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“8½ is a synthesis of modern cinema in terms of narrative invention and reflexivity. The filmmaker’s crisis allows for a glimpse of the doubts, weaknesses and ghosts involved in the creative process, calling into question the idea of an omniscient author secure in their métier. Fellini also develops a penetrating study of the artist’s psychology, projecting it on to his alter ego, played by Marcello Mastroianni.

Her first three films, Water Lilies (2007), Tomboy (2011) and Girlhood (2014), did much to redefine coming-of-age narratives, opening new horizons on youth and queer desire while manifesting a coherent stylistic vision, characterised notably by pareddown visuals. As a result, Sciamma, an alumna of the prestigious Paris film school La Fémis, swiftly rose to the pantheon of French auteur cinema (she scripts all her films). Unusually in the French context, she adroitly coordinated this cinephile pedigree with her lesbian identity and strongly articulated political – including feminist – positions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Portrait of a Lady on Fire brought Sciamma’s work and status to another level. Her first costume film, set on a remote Breton island in the late 18th century, charts in a series of exquisite tableaux the intense passion between two women, a painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), and her model Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). Héloïse is to be married against her will to a rich man on the strength of the portrait. After initial resistance on both women’s parts, the painting becomes the conductor for their love for each other.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In Portrait, Sciamma fights patriarchal oppression first of all by creating a utopian, if temporary, all-women’s world. More fundamentally, the relationship between the two women develops as one of reciprocity and equality. The film thus rejects a hierarchical vision of desire and in the process updates the relationship between artist and model and the fetishised figure of the ‘muse’. Portrait’s egalitarian ethos evidently echoes Sciamma’s own commitment – among other things she is deeply involved in the Collectif 50/50, which fights for gender equality in the French film industry. But the film resonated with the ambient culture in other ways. When it came out in France in the autumn of 2019, Portrait appeared as the perfect illustration of the female gaze, a concept newly ‘discovered’ in a country that was still coming to terms, only slowly, with the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, about which both Sciamma and Haenel (formerly a couple) spoke out in various contexts. Portrait of a Lady on Fire demonstrates Sciamma’s ability to make a timelessly beautiful film that also crystallises the gender politics of her era.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Ginette Vincendeau</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Céline Sciamma\",\"producer\":\"Bénédicte Couvreur\",\"writer\":\"Céline Sciamma\",\"featuring\":\"Merlant, Noémie, Adèle Haenel, Bajrami, Luana\"},\"year\":\"2019\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-2019-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-2019-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/15801\",\"pillar\":\"rentals\",\"price\":3.5,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"France\",\"runningTime\":122,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":29,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"d964bfb7-729b-5181-85f8-35b1bd3a21a3\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Taxi Driver\",\"url\":\"/film/d964bfb7-729b-5181-85f8-35b1bd3a21a3/taxi-driver\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader’s high-art vigilante movie for fallen times, with a coiled Robert De Niro as psycho-saviour of an infernal NYC.\",\"html\":\"<p>Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader’s high-art vigilante movie for fallen times, with a coiled Robert De Niro as psycho-saviour of an infernal NYC.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>Screenwriter Paul Schrader drew on the mythology of 1940s film noir thrillers for this story of Vietnam vet Travis Bickle’s increasingly psychotic disgust at the nocturnal New York street life he observes from his taxi.

Laughton’s masterpiece was immediately dismissed by audience and critics alike: its visual compositions led it to be suspected of artistry, while its refusal to conform to genre was box-office death. The dreamlike sequences of the children’s escape down the river viewed through an enormous spider’s web contrasted with the angular shadows of the light falling into their room, and all pathways lead to Lillian Gish’s final appearance, cradling a gun on the veranda as she waits, singing hymns, for Mitchum to come for his prey.” <strong>Ruth Barton</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Laughton’s career-length frustrations at cinema’s expressive limitations are here redeemed.

In the late 1970s, emboldened by the critical successes of his two Godfather films, Francis Ford Coppola famously spent a vast amount of time and money in the jungles of Southeast Asia to bring to life the story of an American officer (Martin Sheen), sent up river to bring the wayward, megalomaniac Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to ground.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The troubled production – beset by a typhoon, a heart attack (Sheen’s) and the perils of excess – has entered film-making lore, but the resulting film rivals Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 (1968) for its hallucinatory visuals and grandness of conception.

Like his Italian counterpart Fellini, Bergman achieved fame in European art cinema in the 1950s and early 60s but unexpectedly made his masterpiece out of a creative crisis. After the collapse of a project focusing on two actresses, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann (who both had intimate relationships with the director), Bergman spent time in hospital, where he came up with a fresh idea. Struck by the women’s physical likeness, he planned to explore questions of identity through the encounter between a great stage actress (Ullmann) who has inexplicably fallen silent and the insecure, garrulous nurse (Andersson) assigned to look after her. Secluded on the barren island of Fårö (which became Bergman’s favourite location and main home), the protagonists – both brilliantly played – engage in a battle of wills, their divergent attitudes towards sex and motherhood merging in disturbing ways. The erotic intensity and rawness of Persona was challenging in 1966, and remains so – few film ‘classics’ still feel so modern.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory nature of the filmmaking. Bergman begins the film with a violent, fractured opening montage illustrating the nature of cinema itself and keeps ratcheting up the ambiguities by blurring realism and fantasy. Self-reflexivity never seemed so seductive, as the film freely plays with ideas of public masks and inner secrets, vampirism physical and metaphysical, and the fine line between screen performance and real lives.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Persona has virtually defined the outer reaches of subsequent ‘art’ cinema, influencing visionary directors from Robert Altman and Nicolas Roeg to David Lynch and Olivier Assayas. Its iconography has become pervasive – Andersson’s cool blackrimmed sunglasses, the haunting images of the two women facing the camera, all beautifully rendered in the velvety monochrome photography of Sven Nykvist. The film’s overtly Jungian aspects and slippery narrative have provoked many questions and debates; Bergman gave little away, preferring audiences to draw their own conclusions. He followed Persona with some great films, but nothing quite as audacious.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>David Thompson</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Ingmar Bergman\",\"producer\":\"\",\"writer\":\"Ingmar Bergman\",\"featuring\":\"Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Margareta Krook\"},\"year\":\"1966\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Persona (1966)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15480\",\"pillar\":\"subscription\",\"price\":0,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"Sweden\",\"runningTime\":81,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":17,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"3b863389-5735-5b97-86c2-7e52217a7517\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Close-up\",\"url\":\"/film/3b863389-5735-5b97-86c2-7e52217a7517/close-up\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised.\",\"html\":\"<p>The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>From the mid-1990s until his death in 2016, Abbas Kiarostami was widely regarded as one of the most original, innovative and important filmmakers around, an audacious, idiosyncratic artist with a profoundly humane but highly distinctive view of the world. Close-Up is often seen not only as a turning-point in the Iranian’s career – it cemented his confidence in blurring the distinction between ‘documentary’ and ‘fiction’ – but as the film most representative of his aims and achievements.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It could have been a straightforward record of the court case of an unemployed print worker accused of impersonating filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf with the intent of fraudulently obtaining money from a well-to-do family. But in relating the story of Hossein Sabzian’s encounter with the Ahankhahs, Kiarostami characteristically opts for anything but an obvious linear narrative. Mixing 16mm footage of the trial (in which Kiarostami himself seems to ask as many questions as the judge) with recreations of events performed by the family, Sabzian and others playing themselves, he fragments the story into diverse meandering strands that frequently frustrate expectations while still remaining intelligible and engrossing. ‘Important’ events may be left unseen; in their place, sequences in which nothing of any clear consequence happens. Re-enactments occur without giving away whose point of view they represent. The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised. The plot thickens – except that we do, eventually, understand that the accused, for all his strange, seemingly unmotivated deceptions, is undoubtedly a decent human being, worthy of our attention, sympathy and respect.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Though formally inventive, Close-Up confirms that its creator is no formalist. The film is driven both by deep, unsentimental compassion and by genuine philosophical curiosity; it explores the fraught relationships between truth and falsehood, film and ‘reality’, intention and action, and acknowledges, from start to finish, the role and responsibility of the director in his engagement with the people in his film. Also admirably typical of Kiarostami’s best work is his admission – indeed, insistence – that the film is incomplete until viewers respond by engaging with its artifice and actively using their imaginations. For Kiarostami, the unshown, the unsaid, the unknown were crucially important; meaning was inextricably linked to mystery.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Abbas Kiarostami\",\"producer\":\"\",\"writer\":\"Abbas Kiarostami\",\"featuring\":\"Hossein Sabziyan, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abolfazl Ahankhah\"},\"year\":\"1989\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Close-up (1989)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":null,\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[],\"productionCountries\":\"Iran\",\"runningTime\":100,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":16,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"7c5a18ae-b5ba-5a7b-b43f-e9c1895e2f17\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Meshes of the Afternoon\",\"url\":\"/film/7c5a18ae-b5ba-5a7b-b43f-e9c1895e2f17/meshes-of-the-afternoon\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dreamworld of Meshes of the Afternoon?\",\"html\":\"<p>Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dreamworld of Meshes of the Afternoon?</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dream world of Meshes of the Afternoon? Certainly, it soon would, in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) and many later films noirs. That affiliation was first proposed by J. Hoberman in the 1970s. But Meshes has been invoked as seminal by many traditions over eight decades. For years, this 14-minute film was claimed as a founding inspiration of a distinctively American form of highly personal poetic psychodrama, typified by Stan Brakhage, who hailed Deren as “the mother of us all”.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Deren’s hands-on promotion of her work became a model for the co-operative movement of the 1960s. Rising interest in women’s cinema would later refocus attention on her pioneering role. Today, she is the only woman among seven experimental filmmakers featured on the front page of the New York Filmmakers Co-op website, while the haunting image of her at a window must be one of the most widely reproduced stills from any avant-garde film. And rising interest in women’s film after the 1970s would focus attention on her aesthetic of ‘vertical cinema’, creating an emotional and intellectual density within rather than between images, as Barbara Hammer has described it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Both Deren and her co-director Alexander Hammid (originally Hackenschmied) were immigrants from Eastern Europe. She came from a Jewish family background in Ukraine, heavily involved in psychiatry, and he from experimental photography and film in Czechoslovakia. Deren would indignantly reject suggestions of influence from two earlier European avant-garde landmarks, Buñuel and Dalí’s Un chien andalou (1928) and Cocteau’s The Blood of a Poet (Le Sang d’un poète, 1930). But for all its cool originality, the eerie game of repeated symbols that its maker-protagonists play out in their West Hollywood home and garden – with a flower, key and knife linking Deren’s divided self and a sinister mirror-faced figure – has undoubtedly extended the legacy of those earlier works.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meshes has never reached the top 100 before in the S&amp;S poll (despite some interesting previous backers, such as Derek Jarman in 1992).

When was this immaculate feature film, Agnès Varda’s essay on time and space, love and death, ever not on our minds?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arriving with the first surge of the French New Wave, Cléo from 5 to 7 crackles with the energy and modernity of that cinephile movement, but it’s ultimately an introspective piece, characterised by the philosophical preoccupations of Varda’s Left Bank peers. Corinne Marchand plays Cléo, a blonde pop singer whose vanity relaxes as her anxieties swell. As the film begins, she visits a tarot reader, hoping for good news about the medical test results she is awaiting – but the cards spell only death, and transformation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While Cléo’s mind is fixed on the future, Varda’s camera captures her in the present tense, killing time in Paris as she ponders her own decay. Echoing Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, Varda dissects a trip down the stairs to emphasise the moment as it passes, one we would otherwise have missed. As Cléo, a Parisian Mrs Dalloway, walks the streets of her city, Varda also captures a broader sense of time, an era in history: Paris in the early 1960s, with its crowds, cafés, shops, music, fashion and cinema. The geography is precise: Varda called the film “the portrait of a woman painted on to a documentary about Paris”.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The film shifts from colour to blackand- white to remind us that this is what cinema does – it transforms life. A film within the film turns the idea into a joke: life makes no sense in monochrome. But Cléo is transformed by the film, by these 90 minutes and the images of herself and her future that confront her everywhere. In real time, Cléo becomes more real, more subject than object, more human, more in tune with the city. She discards her whipped-cream wig and polka dots for a simple black shift. She performs less and feels more.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the kind of playfulness that Varda enjoyed so much, we could call this ticking- clock film timeless. From the feminist analysis of a woman’s commodified beauty and a celebrity’s self-regarding narcissism to the vulnerable heroine acting out her messy emotions in public, the spectre of war and the fear of disease darkening a midsummer day, Cléo from 5 to 7 feels pertinent to the modern moment.

Renoir, a director associated with the left wing Popular Front, turned his gaze away from working people to the haute bourgeoisie. Taking its cue from the classic stage farces of Musset and Beaumarchais, Renoir sets his action during a shooting weekend at a country house. It’s an upstairs-downstairs world where servants and masters become enmeshed in a tangle of desire, a jumble of motivations in which, in the film’s famous phrase, “Everyone has their reasons”. At the film’s centre is the amiable Octave (played by Renoir), whose best intentions lead to tragedy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Shot in long, controlled takes that stress the depth of vision, Renoir’s depiction of an intransigent society teetering blithely into disaster was derided upon release and only later acclaimed as one of cinema’s most vital films.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“A lesson in life in every word of dialogue, a piece of cinema in every frame.

Hollywood movies are an artform and a mass entertainment, the product of a singular vision and of a ruthless industry, the work of great directors and the alchemical result of a thousand collaborations, coincidences and backsagainst- the-wall snap decisions. The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Francis Ford Coppola\",\"producer\":\"Albert S.

The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen\",\"producer\":\"Arthur Freed\",\"writer\":\"Adolph Green, Betty Comden\",\"featuring\":\"Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds\"},\"year\":\"1951\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Singin' in the Rain (1951)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14090\",\"pillar\":\"rentals\",\"price\":3.5,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"USA\",\"runningTime\":102,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":9,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"cacbb2df-be18-5e59-b5c3-f0eb9ea3a90d\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Man with a Movie Camera\",\"url\":\"/film/cacbb2df-be18-5e59-b5c3-f0eb9ea3a90d/man-with-a-movie-camera\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Bottomless invention and frenetic, dizzying montage make this city symphony one of cinema’s sharpest, most exciting experiences nearly a century after its release.\",\"html\":\"<p>Bottomless invention and frenetic, dizzying montage make this city symphony one of cinema’s sharpest, most exciting experiences nearly a century after its release.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>A decade into his career as both filmmaker and theorist, Dziga Vertov made his best-known and most widely distributed film.

This could easily be an indulgent mess, but Vertov’s grasp of his medium is so philosophically sure-footed that it’s just as stimulating many decades later.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“David Abelevich Kaufman, also known as Dziga Vertov (a Ukrainian phrase roughly meaning ‘spinning top’), was born in 1896 into a Jewish book-dealer’s family in the city of Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, in modernday Poland. He understood Lenin’s philosophy that film was the most important of all the propaganda forms (especially among a largely illiterate population) and his Anniversary of the Revolution (1918), which may be the first documentary ever made, should be studied in every film school. Though none of us have truly experienced Man with a Movie Camera – which has not been seen in its original form since the 1930s due to it being widely replicated and distributed at an inaccurate speed, significantly changing its rhythm and accents in a way that does not match its original score – I’m still dazzled by its artistry and anticipate the forthcoming restoration.” <strong>Dorota Lech</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“‘Down with bourgeois fairytale plots and scenarios – long live life as it is!’ So said Dziga Vertov, for whom documentary was the only true revolutionary form as it freed film from false scenarios and performing actors. Man with a Movie Camera, about life in a Soviet city from dawn to dusk, was certainly revolutionary in its approach to image creation, which continually undermines and extends itself to dazzling and witty effect. As well as Vertov, the Kino-Eye Council of Three – which attempted to engender a new kind of perception through cinematic montage – comprised Vertov’s editor wife, Elizaveta Svilova, and his camera operator brother, Mikhail Kaufman. All three deserve authorship credit for the film.” <strong>Helen DeWitt</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The defining aspirational work of documentary cinema, this film understands and celebrates the power of cinematic manipulation to uncover profound artistic, emotional and existential truths.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The dynamism of Vertov’s camerawork and montage reflect the enthusiasm of the era for speed and movement, presuppositions of urban modernity.” <strong>Carlos Alberto Mattos</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“This dynamic documentary is much more than a great city symphony.

In the deftest of the filmmaker’s gnomic bifurcations, the movie’s flow runs from network-gloss irony, through a tunnel of angst, to a Sapphic wander through Desolation Row, with its two heroines (Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) also doubled up, playing out two contrasting narratives, each potentially and mysteriously the psychic B-side of the other. Identity, in Hollywood, is a quantum reality, a fact that meets Lynch’s lust for instability head on. Perhaps that is the resonating clue as to the film’s ascendant critical regard: its essential, unreasonable slipperiness, its fierce embrace of uncertainty and the indeterminate, speaks more to our fraught present, 21 years later, than it did to its heyday during the pre-9/11 Bush administration. (Not that it wasn’t beloved then, reaping dozens of criticgroup awards and getting Lynch an Oscar nomination for Best Director.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The film’s unironic payload of wrenching heartbreak, swimming up from a swampy dream of ironic strangeness, is singular in his oeuvre, as if the vulnerabilities of young women in the twisty roads and dusty hills of the American movie struck him in ways that the dark plight of smalltown Lumberton/ Twin Peaks high-schoolers didn’t quite? Perhaps. But it’s still a maddening, freaky, mysterious thing, seductively interpretable but, ultimately, Lynchianly resistant to final readings. That’s integral to its allure, too. It’s like a hieroglyph you’re always on the verge of translating or a lover’s sphinx-like expression in bed that suggests betrayal, devotion or something in between.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"David Lynch\",\"producer\":\"Mary Sweeney, Alain Sarde, Neal Edelstein, Michael Polaire, Tony Krantz, Joyce Eliason\",\"writer\":\"David Lynch\",\"featuring\":\"Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, Laura Harring\"},\"year\":\"2001\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Mulholland Dr. (2001)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14931\",\"pillar\":\"rentals\",\"price\":3.5,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"France, USA\",\"runningTime\":146,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":7,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Beau travail\",\"url\":\"/film/bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005/beau-travail\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Claire Denis’s great gift is to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition.

My face split into a grin of disbelief as the credits rolled and I rewound the final scene. More than 20 years after its initial release, that set piece, soundtracked by Corona’s 90s Eurodance hit ‘The Rhythm of the Night’, with its climactic burst of feeling, is as well-known as the film itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It started as a sort of joke. Claire Denis was commissioned by the TV network Arte to make a film about foreignness and so, wryly, provocatively, she made a movie in which her own people were the foreigners. In Marseille, Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant) reflects on his time as ‘a perfect legionnaire’ in Djibouti, East Africa, serving the French Foreign Legion. He and his soldiers, including the undeniably pretty and unusually well-liked Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin), perform highly choreographed military drills in the desert heat. Under the blazing sun, resentments simmer. In the evenings, the men dance at a nightclub with the local women, who are beautiful, modern and ambivalent. Djibouti, a former French colony, gained independence in 1977. These soldiers are irrelevant; the colonial project is obsolete. ‘Unfit for life, unfit for civilian life’ is how Galoup describes himself in his diary.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But feeling unmoored from one’s purpose – feeling like a foreigner to your own life – is a timeless conundrum, and one that seems to resonate with both film lovers and filmmakers (Barry Jenkins has mentioned its influence on 2016’s Moonlight). It remains Denis’s only true crowd-pleaser.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Denis’s great gift is her ability to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition. In the Djibouti desert, water shimmers and ripples, naked shoulders perspire and black mosquito nets recall sheer lingerie. In a Claire Denis film, dialogue is sparse, but images are charged with meaning. ‘Making films, for me, is to get rid of explanation,’ she told the Guardian back in 2000.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The final scene is pure release: a wordless explanation after 90 minutes of tension. Visual references travel through quotations in other works and, in recent times, through the internet. Films are portioned up and divorced from their original contexts, re-appropriated and shared as memes. I wonder if the renewed popularity of Beau travail in this decade’s Greatest Films poll is a result of its increased visibility among a younger generation, many of whom have likely encountered, or at least revisited, its euphoric dancefloor-set conclusion via their computers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Simran Hans</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Claire Denis\",\"producer\":\"Jérôme Minet, Patrick Grandperret\",\"writer\":\"Jean-Pol Fargeau, Claire Denis\",\"featuring\":\"Denis Lavant, Michel Subor, Grégoire Colin\"},\"year\":\"1998\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Beau travail (1998)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":null,\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[],\"productionCountries\":\"France\",\"runningTime\":93,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":6,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"cefccdb2-b558-5623-9c17-72b4be7bd4c1\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"2001: A Space Odyssey\",\"url\":\"/film/cefccdb2-b558-5623-9c17-72b4be7bd4c1/2001-a-space-odyssey\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Stanley Kubrick’s grand vision of mankind’s journey from its hominid beginnings to its star-child evolution is a towering achievement of science-fiction cinema.\",\"html\":\"<p>Stanley Kubrick’s grand vision of mankind’s journey from its hominid beginnings to its star-child evolution is a towering achievement of science-fiction cinema.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>A year before the first moon landing, Stanley Kubrick envisioned an outer space where vast spacecraft revolve weightlessly to the strains of Johann Strauss’s Blue Danube waltz. 2001 revolutionised the depiction of the cosmos on film, at the same time – with the HAL-9000 computer that fatally malfunctions during a mission to Jupiter – sounding a warning about unbridled technological advance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Beginning with primordial apes discovering tools and climaxing with astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) travelling beyond the limits of the known universe, Kubrick’s film was an intellectual (and psychedelic) event in the late 1960s. A ‘match cut’ which quickly replaces a bone thrown upwards by an ape with a similarly shaped spaceship floating through space, thereby compressing millennia of human evolution, is justly celebrated.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“‘If Kubrick could get rid of the human element, he could make the perfect film,’ joked Malcolm McDowell. But here, he almost does. By acting, arrogantly, as if nobody had ever made a really good science-fiction film before, Kubrick solves all the genre’s problems methodically but also pushes it into epic, mythic, spiritual terrain. It’s stately, bold, astonishingly beautiful. The great rationalist suddenly blasts us off into a psychedelic experience which doesn’t yield fully to reason. It’s not even certain if the film is optimistic or despairing (yet colourful).” <strong>David Cairns</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Kubrick’s epic contemplation on the nature and origins of humanity remains one of cinema’s greatest technical feats, and one of its most poetic and awe-inspiring.” <strong>Stuart Brown</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Human evolution, both physical and spiritual, translated into confoundingly hypnotic imagery.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“2001: A Space Odyssey created a vocabulary from a vacuum; there was nothing like it before or after.

Ten years ago, it stood out as the best-performing film of the 21st century in the critics’ list, landing in 24th place. With a fresh generation of critics chiming in – one that cinematically came of age when Wong’s film had already attained modern-classic status – it was sure to rise up the ranks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the Mood for Love’s spectacular top five placement, however, demonstrates the broadly seductive allure of a mid-century Hong Kong period piece that looks both forward and back, wallowing in nostalgia for a purer, lusher form of cinematic romanticism while carving out more modern, even avant-garde forms of sensual and psychological expression from its saturated style. It’s a film that invites you to think, “They don’t make them like they used to” – even though you know they never quite made them quite like this. The film’s essential romantic narrative of forbidden yearnings and missed connections may be the stuff of vintage melodrama, but less familiar is the way Wong expands the simple anatomy of a thwarted love affair into an elastic meditation on personal unrest, political statelessness and the violence of time’s unrelenting passage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The film never tells you it’s about any of that, of course. Wong’s porous, often headily non-verbal filmmaking trusts us to feel the lovers’ ennui and melancholy – and further, to identify it within ourselves – via its sheer accumulation of sounds, images and sense memories: be it the damp wraiths of steam swirling from an opened noodle container, the warm, vinyl-roughened croon of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack or the impossible lobby-card beauty of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, both preserved here in their ravishing prime, and somehow convincing as ordinary mortals made movie-star beautiful by love.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’re living through a fairly stifled age of visual storytelling, as the televisual pull of streaming culture encourages filmmakers to think smaller and more literal. As moving as its relationship study is, anybody who thinks of In the Mood for Love, however, thinks first of those sensory flourishes and grace notes – it’s a film that even, somehow, has a signature scent. Its visual and sonic fragments cumulatively evoke not just a firmly past time and place but a mood, a feeling, a sorrow that drifts from the film’s world to ours. That must account for its enduring, even increasing, popularity: it lingers like an unrequited crush.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Wong Kar Wai\",\"producer\":\"Wong Kar Wai\",\"writer\":\"Wong Kar Wai\",\"featuring\":\"Maggie Cheung Man-yuk, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Rebecca Pan Di-hua\"},\"year\":\"2000\",\"nameAndYear\":\"In the Mood for Love (2000)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":null,\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[],\"productionCountries\":\"Hong Kong, France\",\"runningTime\":98,\"sightAndSound\":null}},{\"rank\":4,\"tied\":false,\"film\":{\"uuid\":\"65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383\",\"image\":{\"base\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/\",\"relative\":\"2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg\",\"main\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg\",\"thumb\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg\",\"preload\":\"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg\",\"altText\":null},\"name\":\"Tokyo Story\",\"url\":\"/film/65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383/tokyo-story\",\"summary\":{\"text\":\"Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.\",\"html\":\"<p>Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.</p>\\r\\n\"},\"fullDescription\":\"<p>The later films of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu are marked by a striking uniformity of theme and form.

Of all the films that could surmount this poll (there have now been four, across eight decades), it seems apt that Alfred Hitchcock’s woozy psychoromance should lose its grip as soon as it reached the summit – that this delirious maunder with James Stewart’s acrophobic, impressionable detective through an absurd murder-seduction intrigue in a winding San Francisco wonderland should place less steadily than the obdurate Citizen Kane (1941), previously enshrined on high for 40 years. Still, its fall has been less steep than that of Bicycle Thieves (1948), which sank from first to seventh between 1952 and 1962, or this year’s plunge of Jean Renoir’s La Règle du jeu (1939), previously a top-ten perennial, from fourth to 13th. Vertigo came just seven votes short of the top spot – proportionally closer than in 2002, when it missed deposing Orson Welles’s reigning champ by only four votes – while the distance between it and Kane (now third) has grown since 2012, from 34 votes to 45. This is not a film in rapid descent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As of last year, Vertigo’s 1958 release date puts it in the first half of cinema’s history. As that history extends, and this poll grows, so the greater diversity of latter-day filmmaking stretches the voting. In 2012 the film led with 191 votes – meaning it was included in almost a quarter of the entries; this year its 208 votes amounted to half that proportion, 12 per cent. Lifting the lid of the poll, though, shows a more fluid story than just new voters moving on from the old. Vertigo lost nearly three-quarters (139) of its 2012 electors: three-fifths of them to voter attrition (those voters who for whatever reason didn’t show up in 2022), but more turned away from Vertigo (57) than stuck with it (54). Sixteen swung behind it this year after choosing otherwise in 2012. Meanwhile 140 of its 208 votes came from new – and presumably younger – recruits to the electorate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After a decade of debate about the justices of cinematic representation, I’d wondered how Hitchcock’s frayed, pessimistic thriller of estrangement would now strike people. Filtering Pygmalion myths of idealisation and exploitation through Proustian memory games – with Bernard Herrmann’s score adding top notes of Wagnerian tragedy – it’s hardly a film that promises hope or amelioration, more a darkly, bottomlessly reflexive portrait of private vices and compulsions; a vortex of perspective-stretching, misdirection and disorientation; a whirlpool of obscure, consuming desire. It seems many of us are still plunging in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Nick Bradshaw</strong></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Alfred Hitchcock\",\"producer\":\"\",\"writer\":\"Alec Coppel, Samuel A.

Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) heads the 2022 list. No other film made by a woman has ever even reached the top ten. In the first instance, this is unsurprising: women film directors have always, obviously, been few and far between; equally obviously, the contributing critics have been predominantly male. It was when Sight and Sound expanded the critics’ pool in 2012 that Jeanne Dielman first entered the list, at number 35; its rise to the top now is a triumph for women’s cinema.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But perhaps the ultimate surprise goes even further: the film that collected the most votes in 2022 is made with a cinematic style and strategy closer to avantgarde than mainstream traditions and, furthermore, at just under three and a half hours, demands dedicated viewing. Although confrontational, idiosyncratic and extraordinary films have consistently appeared lower in the lists, the experimental tradition, to which Jeanne Dielman belongs, is – apart perhaps from the recent appearance of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) – absent. While it has brought this tradition to the top of the list, Jeanne Dielman is inescapably a woman’s film, consciously feminist in its turn to the avant garde. On the side of content, the film charts the breakdown of a bourgeois Belgian housewife, mother and part-time prostitute over the course of three days; on the side of form, it rigorously records her domestic routine in extended time and from a fixed camera position. In a film that, agonisingly, depicts women’s oppression, Akerman transforms cinema, itself so often an instrument of women’s oppression, into a liberating force.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Read the <a href=\\\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/features/greatest-film-all-time-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles\\\">full article by Laura Mulvey</a></p>\\r\\n\",\"quote\":null,\"credits\":{\"director\":\"Chantal Akerman\",\"producer\":\"Evelyne Paul, Corinne Jenart\",\"writer\":\"Chantal Akerman\",\"featuring\":\"Delphine Seyrig, Jan Decorte, Henri Storck\"},\"year\":\"1975\",\"nameAndYear\":\"Jeanne Dielman  23, Quai du Commerce  1080 Bruxelles (1975)\",\"links\":{\"player\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles-1975-online\",\"southbank\":\"\"},\"player\":{\"url\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles-1975-online\",\"cta\":\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15785\",\"pillar\":\"subscription\",\"price\":0,\"duration\":0},\"performances\":[],\"channels\":[\"BFI Player\"],\"productionCountries\":\"Belgium, France\",\"runningTime\":201,\"sightAndSound\":null}}],\"title\":\"The Greatest Films of All Time\",\"image\":{\"src\":\"/dist/server/2ebc4259d436c114628a2210fa5e5421.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Jeanne Dielman 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)\"},\"standfirst\":\"\\n      <p>In 1952, the Sight and Sound team had the novel idea of asking critics to name the greatest films of all time.
